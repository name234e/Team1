        You know what's sucky about regular Houses? They are expensive; The typical house cost is 499,000 in Long, Island New York. What fun is that kind of house? We'll answer that: NO FUN AT ALL. You know what is fun? Using the Capsule Home by Capsule Net to cut your living cuts in half. No money? Apply to the red cross to get one for free now! The Capsule Home is portable house in a 2d foot long storage box, being furnished with a 3d printer that prints both practical items and food, and basic utilites and now it has built in face recognition for security and the house can be easily built at a price of 14,600 which means you save 484,000 if you live in Long Island.
        <br> 3D printed homes cost around 10 thousand dollars to make. Building a printed house is faster than constructing a regular traditional house. Printed homes are usually 20% cheaper than what it would cost to build a traditional house. 3D printing with eco friendly or materials that are less likely to harm the earth ultimately benefit our wellbeing. Countries like China and Denmark have used materials such as industrial rubber and oil-based materials that prevent us from creating a substantial amount of waste.
        Wi-sun a company based in China has printed 10 homes in 24 hours at about $5,000. These houses are affordable and are able to provide families and the homeless and is very accessible. These low prices and our ideas for the capsule net make solving this issue a little more possible. 3D printed homes are expected to last as long or longer than CMU’s and are built according to the IBC structural code. Making them as safe as any other traditional home. Non for profit organizations like ours are focused on building homes that are adequate enough for low-income families, third world countries and the homeless. Printing homes create sustainable cities and communities. New Story CEO Brett Hagles says “ Building a traditional New Story community of 100 homes will take close to a year". With a 3D printer, if we just had one, it would take up to complete the community. </br>
